# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately estimate the prices of properties based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.

# Project Overview
Real estate prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. This project aims to tackle this problem by leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and predict future prices.

# Key Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about properties, such as their location, size, number of rooms, age, and other features. The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive EDA is conducted to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between different features and property prices.

Feature Engineering: New features are created to enhance the predictive power of the model. This includes transforming existing features and creating interaction terms.

Model Building: Various machine learning models are built and evaluated, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and more. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Cross-validation is used to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data.

Deployment: The final model is deployed as a web application, allowing users to input property details and receive price predictions in real-time.
